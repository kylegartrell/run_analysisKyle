for the variable names I used the variables from the features text file( 561 variable names).

I changed these acronyms: acc=accelerator, mag=magnitude, gyro=gyroscope, ^t=time, and ^f=frequency,

There are 563 columns and the data comes from the x, y, and subject text files.  The variable names come from the features text file 
except for the first 2 columns.  I called those variables person.id and data_set.  

Person.id is self-explanatory, and data_set corresponds to the training data and testing data.  In the final tidy data, under
data_set the 1 corresponds to training data and 2 corresponds to testing data.

The data comes from an "experiment" performed by 30 volunteers and tries to identify human activity based on certain movement patterns.
